Group Project Information
The course evaluation depends for a large part on a group project that needs to be submitted in groups of 4 students. During the group project, you will engage in a data science project in which you are free to explore your own topics of interests using a dataset provided by the teaching team. 

Dataset
This year's dataset will be related to Horizon Europe , i.e., the European Union's key funding program for research and innovation for the period 2021–2027. It is the successor to Horizon 2020 and has a budget of €95.5 billion, making it one of the largest research and innovation programs in the world.

The key objectives of Horizon Europe are the following:

Tackling Global Challenges – Supports research in areas like climate change, health, digitalization, and security.
Boosting EU Competitiveness – Aims to enhance Europe's leadership in science, technology, and innovation.
Strengthening the European Research Area (ERA) – Encourages collaboration among EU countries and international partners.
To do so, they divided the structure of Horizon Europe into three main pillars:

Excellent Science – Supports frontier research through programs like the European Research Council (ERC) and Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA).
Global Challenges & Industrial Competitiveness – Funds research missions in health, climate, energy, food, and more.
Innovative Europe – Focuses on supporting startups and scaling up breakthrough innovations via the European Innovation Council (EIC).
There are also cross-cutting initiatives, including support for widening participation across Europe and strengthening research infrastructures.

In that context, the CORDIS EU Research Projects under Horizon Europe (2021–2027) (CORDIS) dataset is a valuable resource for exploring projects funded under the Horizon Europe program.

One aspect of this project is to analyse the CORDIS dataset, offering a wealth of possibilities for analysis, visualization, and insights.

Information
The CORDIS dataset contains information about projects and their results funded by the European Union under the Horizon Europe framework programme for research and innovation from 2021 to 2027.

The dataset is composed of six (6) different sub-set (in different formats):

HORIZON projects – which includes participating organisations, legal basis information, topic information, project URLs and classification with the European Science Vocabulary (EuroSciVoc)
HORIZON project deliverables (meta-data and links to deliverables)
HORIZON project publications (meta-data and links to publications)
HORIZON report summaries (periodic or final publishable summaries)
Reference data (programmes, topics, topic keywords funding schemes (types of action), organisation types and countries) can be found in this dataset: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/cordisref-data

EuroSciVoc is available here: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/euroscivoc-the-european-science-vocabulary

CORDIS datasets are produced monthly.

Remark: While the main focus will be on Horizon Europe projects, analytical methods can be extended to other EU-funded programs or even global research initiatives. Therefore, you can either stick to the CORDIS dataset, and/or extend it with additional open-source information.

HORIZON projects
The CORDIS EU Research Projects under Horizon Europe (2021–2027) dataset provides detailed information on projects funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe framework program. This dataset includes several key variables that offer insights into each project's specifics:

Project Identifier (ID): A unique alphanumeric code assigned to each project for identification purposes.
Project Acronym: A shortened form or abbreviation representing the project's title.
Project Title: The official name of the research project.
Project Description: A brief overview outlining the project's objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes.
Start Date: The commencement date of the project.
End Date: The scheduled completion date of the project.
Project Status: Indicates whether the project is ongoing, completed, or terminated.
Total Cost: The overall budget allocated for the project, including all funding sources.
EU Contribution: The amount of financial support provided by the European Union for the project.
Funding Scheme: The specific Horizon Europe funding mechanism under which the project falls.
Coordinator Details: Information about the lead organization managing the project, including name, location, and contact details.
Participants: A list of all organizations involved in the project, along with their roles and countries of origin.
Topics: The research areas or themes addressed by the project, aligned with Horizon Europe's priorities.
Programme: The specific program or sub-program under Horizon Europe that funds the project.
Call Identifier: The reference to the specific call for proposals to which the project responded.
Project URL: A link to the project's official website or page for more detailed information can be found here: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/cordis-eu-research-projects-under-horizon-europe-2021-2027?locale=en

These variables enable stakeholders to analyze various aspects of EU-funded research projects, such as funding distribution, collaboration networks, and thematic focus areas. The dataset is accessible in multiple formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML, facilitating diverse analytical approaches.
